Crowdsourcing setting
=====
Potato can be seamlessly deployed online to collect annotations from common crowdsourcing platforms like Prolifc.com


Setup potato on a server with open ports
------------
To run potato in a crowdsourcing setup, you need to setup potato on a server with open ports (ports that can be accessed via open internet). When you start the potato server, simply change to default port to the openly accessible ports and you should be able to access the annotation page via you_ip_address:the_port


Prolific 
------------
Prolific is a platform where you can easily recruit task participants and Potato can be used seamlessly with prolific.co. To used potato with prolific.co, you need to define the login type as `url_direct` and set up the "url_argument" as 'PROLIFIC_PID'.

.. code-block:: YAML

    #defining the ways annotators entering the annotation system
    "login": {
       "type": 'url_direct',    #can be 'password' or 'url_direct'
       "url_argument": 'PROLIFIC_PID' # when the login type is set to 'url_direct', 'url_argument' must be setup for a direct url argument login
    },
    
It is also recommended to set the "jumping_to_id_disabled" and "hide_navbar" as True

.. code-block:: YAML

   #the jumping-to-id function will be disabled if "jumping_to_id_disabled" is True
    "jumping_to_id_disabled": False,

   #the navigation bar will be hidden to the annotators if "hide_navbar" is True
    "hide_navbar": True,
