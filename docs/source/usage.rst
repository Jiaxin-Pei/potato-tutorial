Usage
=====

Getting started with Potato is easy! Here's what you need to do:


Install Potato to your machine
---------------

Potato has a Python-based server architecture that can be run locally or hosted on any device. In order to install Potato: 

* Make sure you have Python version 3 installed 
* Follow the quickstart instructions `here <https://potato-annotation-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start.html>`_.


Set up the project data
------------

In order to input document and specify:

* `Prepare <https://potato-annotation-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_format.html#prepare-your-input-data>`_ your input data (csv, tsv, or json) and upload it in the ``data`` folder
* Specify where and in what format you want the `output <https://potato-annotation-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_format.html#update-output-data-preferences-on-the-yaml-config-file>`_ data 
* Optional: Update the config YAML file with `input <https://potato-annotation-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_format.html#update-input-data-formats-on-the-yaml-config-file>`_ and `output <https://potato-annotation-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_format.html#update-output-data-preferences-on-the-yaml-config-file>`_ data preferences


Create your codebook and schema
----------------

Next, you'll need to specify what annotators annotate: 

* Create your annotation codebook and `link it <https://potato-annotation-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/schemas_and_templates.html#add-the-codebook-to-the-page>`_ to the annotation interface
* Specify the `schema <https://potato-annotation-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/schemas_and_templates.html>`_, including:

  * Annotation Type: ``multiselect`` (checkboxes), ``radio`` (single selection), ``likert`` (scale with endpoints labeled), or ``text`` (free-form)
  * Questions for annotators 
  * Answer Choices for multiselect and radio types 
  * End Labels and Length for likert type questions
  * Optional Question Features: ``required``, ``horizontal`` (placement of answers is horizontal not vertical), ``has_free_response`` (whether to include an open text box at the end of multiselect or radio question, like having an "other" option)
  * Optional Answer Features: `tooltips <https://potato-annotation-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/productivity.html#tooltips>`_, `keyboard shortcuts <https://potato-annotation-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/productivity.html#keyboard-shortcuts>`_, `keywords to highlight <https://potato-annotation-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/productivity.html#dynamic-highlighting>`_

* Optional: Format the schema for the YAML config file (`basic examples <https://potato-annotation-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/schemas_and_templates.html>`_, `advanced examples <https://potato-annotation-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/productivity.html>`_)



Define annotation settings
----------------

There are a few other settings you can play with:

* Choose an existing `html template <https://potato-annotation-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/schemas_and_templates.html#choose-or-create-your-html-template>`_ for the annotation task or create a new one
* Optional: Specify privacy and access `settings <https://potato-annotation-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_and_collaboration.html>`_ for the task
* Optional: Update the YAML file with the `look and feel <https://potato-annotation-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/schemas_and_templates.html#update-yaml-file-with-look-and-feel>`_.
* Optional: Set up `active learning <https://potato-annotation-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/productivity.html#active-learning>`_


Launch potato locally
---------------

And that's it! You can go ahead and get started labeling data in one of two ways:

**Option 1:** Follow the prompts given above to define a YAML file that specifies the data sources, server configuration, annotation schemes, and any custom visualizations (`examples <https://github.com/davidjurgens/potato/tree/master/config/examples>`_) and then launch potato.

``python3 potato/flask_server.py config/examples/simple-check-box.yaml -p 8000``

**Option 2:** Launch potato without a YAML. In this case, the server will have you follow a series of prompts about the task and automatically generate a YAML file for you. A YAML file is then passed to the server on the command line to launch the server for annotation.

``python3 potato/flask_server.py -p 8000``


This will launch the webserver on port 8000 which can be accessed at http://localhost:8000. You can `create an account <https://potato-annotation-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_and_collaboration.html>`_ and start labeling data. Clicking "Submit" will autoadvance to the next instance and you can navigate between items using the arrow keys. Potato currently supports one annotation task per server instance, though multiple servers may be run on different posts to concurrently annotate different data.
